# SEO Enhancements Report

To improve search engine visibility and traffic without altering UI or functionality, the following technical SEO optimizations have been applied:

## 1. Meta Tag Optimization
*   **Titles**: Updated `<title>` tags across all 45+ tool pages to be descriptive and keyword-rich (e.g., "Compress PDF - Reduce PDF File Size Online Free").
*   **Descriptions**: Added unique `<meta name="description">` tags for each tool, summarizing its function and benefits to improve click-through rates (CTR) from search results.
*   **Keywords**: Added targeted `<meta name="keywords">` tags with high-volume search terms (e.g., "merge pdf, combine pdf, online pdf tool").

## 2. Structured Data (Schema.org)
*   **SoftwareApplication Schema**: Injected JSON-LD structured data into every tool page. This helps Google understand that the page is a software application, potentially enabling rich snippets (like app details) in search results.
    *   Includes `name`, `description`, `operatingSystem`, `applicationCategory`, and `offers` (Free).

## 3. Sitemap & Indexing
*   **Comprehensive Sitemap**: Regenerated `sitemap.xml` to include all 51 pages (Home, About, Contact, Privacy, Terms + 46 Tools).
*   **Robots.txt**: Verified configuration to allow full crawling of the site.

## 4. Performance (SEO Factor)
*   **PWA Foundation**: The previously added Service Worker and Manifest support faster loading times, which is a ranking factor for Google.

## Summary of Changes
*   **Files Modified**: All `.html` files in `tools/` directory, `sitemap.xml`.
*   **UI Impact**: None.
*   **Functionality Impact**: None.

These changes provide the best possible foundation for organic search growth.
